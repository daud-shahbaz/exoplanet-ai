# Exoplanet-AI  
This project is our submission for the *2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge* under the theme:  
**A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI**

## Project Overview
We are building an AI/ML model that can analyze open-source NASA exoplanet datasets to automatically detect potential exoplanets.  
Traditionally, most exoplanets have been identified manually, but with advances in AI, we aim to speed up and improve this process.

## Team : Burqa Avengers
- **Daud Shahbaz — Team Lead**  
  Guiding direction, coordinating tasks, and ensuring smooth collaboration.  
- **Abhia Azhar & Maheen Sajid — Strategy & Documentation Leads**  
  Handling research planning, documentation standards, and keeping the team aligned with project goals.  
- **Sameed Irfan — Web Lead**  
  Managing front-end/back-end development, data visualization, and web-based tools.  
- **Aswad Sheeraz — ML/Data Lead**  
  Exploring machine learning models, data pipelines, and algorithm optimization.  
- **Abdul Muiz — Research & Strategy**  
  Diving into exoplanetary science background, scouting relevant datasets, and helping refine approaches.

  ## Repository Structure
- `README.md` → Project documentation  
- `data/` → datasets used in the project  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for experiments  
- `src/` → main source code for the model and training  
- `web/` → frontend/backend files for visualization

## Challenge Goal
Use AI/ML to process exoplanet datasets and accurately identify exoplanets while keeping the workflow structured and well-documented.
